## Marcin Natanek's dotfiles

My configuration files with installation script.

### Content

* zhsrc (based on grml, not much added)
* tmux.conf (and support tmux_battery.sh script)
* bashrc

### Installation
Just run:

>cd ~
>git clone https://github.com/mnatan/dotfiles
>cd dotfiles
>./install.sh in git directory

It will create directory with your old configs and create links to mine within ~/dotfiles. Do not remove it!
